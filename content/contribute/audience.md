As knowing the audience is the first step of design, it is useful to define it.

[The Darktable survey](https://eng.aurelienpierre.com/2023/01/who-are-the-darktable-users/) of 2020 showed an abnormal bias among users, favouring highly-educated men coming from technical and scientific background, and with higher programming skills than the average population. This is problematic because it does not overlap with the sociology of photographers at large (regarding computer skills as well as men/women ratio), but is a filtered subset of that social group.

Ansel expects its users to have

- an intermediate knowledge of __color theory__ (brightness vs. lightness vs. luminance, chroma vs. saturation, additive models, delta E, etc.), [^1]
- an intermediate knowledge of __cameras__ (ISO, dynamic range, exposure bias, etc.),[^2]
- an intermediate to advanced knowledge of __stage lighting__ (illuminant, CRI, cast shadows, inverse square law of lighting, etc.)

As such, Ansel does not target beginners and will be more (photography-wise) technical than proprietary competitors, which are frustrating to use for advanced users. That increased technical rootedness is meant to unlock more accurate and fine-grained control over image (especially color) manipulations, it is by no mean technics for the sake of it.

However, Ansel expects average computer-savvy users, with no scripting or programming skills. As such, tasks achieved through the command line interface or direct editing of configuration files should remain exceptionnal, alternative to GUIÂ ways, and limited to advanced tasks.
