I try my best to help everyone but there are limits I crossed in the past *(working 60h/week or debugging in bed at 2 am)* that I'm not willing to cross again. Please remember that :

1. photography might be your hobby but it is my job,
2. there is one of me and many of you,
3. I enjoy vacations and week-end as much as you do,
4. office hours are 10:00 – 19:00, Paris local time (UTC+02), Monday to Friday.

1. Try to use the public channels above as much as possible, in order to leave archives that can be indexed by search engines and found later to help other people,
2. Try to use search engines as much as possible because there are good chances that your problem already has a solution, for the aforementionned reason,
3. As a last resort, if your pictures are personal or sensitive and you don't want to post them on the internet :
    1. Drop your files on my [private cloud](https://cloud.apmlt.net/s/YAdfYajPkE5nLyW), in a `.zip` archive having a meaninful name (for example containing your email address),
    2. [Send me an email](https://aurelienpierre.com/contact/) mentionning the name of the files dropped on the cloud with a description of your issue.

{{< warning >}}
Please upload your files on my [private cloud](https://cloud.apmlt.net/s/YAdfYajPkE5nLyW) instead of using third-party hosting services with an expiration date : there is no guaranty I will download the files in time and it keeps things tidy for me.
